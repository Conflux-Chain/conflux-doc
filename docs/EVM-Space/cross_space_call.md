# The CrossSpaceCall InternalContract

CIP-90 also introduces a new internal contract: `CrossSpaceCall` (0x0888000000000000000000000000000000000006) , which is located in the Core Space. CrossSpaceCall enables `CFX and data` to be crossed between the two spaces. 

```js
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity >=0.5.0;

interface CrossSpaceCall {
    event Call(bytes20 indexed sender, bytes20 indexed receiver, uint256 value, uint256 nonce, bytes data);

    event Create(bytes20 indexed sender, bytes20 indexed contract_address, uint256 value, uint256 nonce, bytes init);

    event Withdraw(bytes20 indexed sender, address indexed receiver, uint256 value, uint256 nonce);

    event Outcome(bool success);

    // Create contract in EVM Space
    function createEVM(bytes calldata init) external payable returns (bytes20);
    
    // Transfer CFX to EVM address
    function transferEVM(bytes20 to) external payable returns (bytes memory output);

    // Call EVM contract method
    function callEVM(bytes20 to, bytes calldata data) external payable returns (bytes memory output);

    function staticCallEVM(bytes20 to, bytes calldata data) external view returns (bytes memory output);

    // Widthdraw CFX from EVM Space's mapped account
    function withdrawFromMapped(uint256 value) external;

    // Query EVM Space mapped account's CFX balance
    function mappedBalance(address addr) external view returns (uint256);

    // Query EVM Space mapped account's nonce
    function mappedNonce(address addr) external view returns (uint256);
}
```

## Cross space of CFX

### From Core to eSpace

Crossing CFX from Conflux Core to eSpace can be done by calling the `CrossSpaceCall.transferEVM(targetAddress)` method. While calling this method, you also need to specify the receiverAddress with parameters and the amount to be crossed in with the value of this transaction. 

Take js-conflux-sdk(v2) as an exampleï¼š

```js
const { Conflux, format, Drip, CONST } = require('js-conflux-sdk');
// Init conflux instance
const conflux = new Conflux({
  url: "https://test.confluxrpc.com",
  networkId: 1
});
// Add account private key
const account = conflux.wallet.addPrivateKey(process.env.PRIVATE_KEY);  // Replace PRIVTE_KEY with your own private key
// CrossCall
const CrossSpaceCall = conflux.InternalContract('CrossSpaceCall');

async function main() {
  // The eSpace receiver address
  const receiverAddress = "0x02e1A5817ABf2812f04c744927FC91F03099C0f4";

  const receipt = await CrossSpaceCall
    .transferEVM(receiverAddress)
    .sendTransaction({
      from: account.address,
      value: Drip.fromCFX(1),
    })
    .executed();

  console.log('Cross transfer: ', receipt.outcomeStatus === CONST.TX_STATUS.SUCCESS ? 'Success' : 'Fail');
}

main().catch(console.log);
```

As long as the `CrossSpaceCall.transferEVM(targetAddress)` method is called successfully, you can see the change by looking up the balance of the receiverAddress in eSpace.

### From eSpace back to Core

There will be two steps while crossing CFX from eSpace back to Core.

1. Transfer CFX to the mapped account of the receiver Core space address in eSpace.
2. Call `CrossSpaceCall.withdrawFromMapped(amount)` in Core with the receiver address to withdraw the CFX.

Example of using js-conflux-sdk v2 to cross back CFX:

```js
// Check above init code
async function main() {
  const receipt = await CrossSpaceCall
    .withdrawFromMapped(Drip.fromCFX(1))
    .sendTransaction({
      from: account.address,
    })
    .executed();

  console.log('Cross transfer: ', receipt.outcomeStatus === CONST.TX_STATUS.SUCCESS ? 'Success' : 'Fail');
}

main().catch(console.log);
```

The above example is intended to demonstrate the technical details of crossing CFX between two spaces. Users can use the [Space Bridge Dapp](https://evm.fluentwallet.com) to cross CFX directly through their wallets.
