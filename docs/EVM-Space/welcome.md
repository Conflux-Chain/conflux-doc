The Conflux `eSpace` is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) built in the Conflux `core space`,
that provides a solution for developers to deploy their apps on an Ethereum-compatible, high-throughput, scalable and future-safe platform,
with low transaction costs for their users.

In Conflux eSpace, Ethereum native applications can seamlessly be ported to Conflux network.
Developers may enjoy familiar Ethereum tooling when working with their Solidity smart contracts on Conflux.

Besides the EVM, Conflux developed the [Space Bridge](https://evm.fluentwallet.com) which allows users to transfer CFX between Conflux core Spance and eSpace.

Conflux eSpace is introduced at [CIP-90](https://github.com/Conflux-Chain/CIPs/blob/master/CIPs/cip-90.md)
